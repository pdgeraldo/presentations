# A little bit about my research

## About me

I am a computational social scientist conducting research across disciplinary boundaries, with a focus on conceptual and methodological *clarification*.

. . . 

* **Academic background**
  + Currently: PhD Candidate in Sociology and MS in Statistics at UCLA
  + Former: MS in Sociology, work in educational research and public policy (Chile)
   
. . .

* **Affiliations**
  + California Center of Population Research (CCPR)
    + Graduate Certificate in Population Studies (Demography)
    
. . .

* **Training and collaborations**
  + Sociology, PoliSci, Statistics, Biostats, Epidemiology, Economics, Public Policy
  + Collaborators mostly from Statistics and Anthropology
  

## Research Overview

. . .

### *Feasible* Causal Inference

In collaboration with Chad Hazlett (PoliSci and Statistics)

  + UCLA Causality group (Stats + Epi + CS)
  + Applied causal inference + teaching focus
  + ML/DL for heterogeneous treatment effects (with Jennie Brand and Bernie Koch)
  
. . .

### Computational Social Science

In collaboration with Jacob Foster (Sociology)

  + "Deflationary" accounts of empirical research (social genomics, MARL)
  + Methods for animal behavioral innovation and social learning (with Susan Perry)
  + Co-organizer of the SICSS-UCLA (2019-2021)

## Research Overview

. . .

### Educational Inequality

  + Comparative study of tracking systems
  + Political economy of skill formation systems
  + General vs Vocational education in Chile
  
. . .

### Dissertation Proposal

  + **Chapter 1**: Moving beyond templates of empirical research

  + [**Chapter 2**: Tracking before tracking? Effects of vocational high schools on students performance and expectations]{.fragment .highlight-blue}

  + **Chapter 3**: Secondary effects of Free College in Chile on students' academic plans and decisions

  
# Tracking Before Tracking?

## Educational Stratification

<br>
The expansion of secondary education during the 20th century was accompanied by  contrasting  expectations. 

* Equalizing effect on attainment and skills^[Raftery and Hout 1993; Raudenbush and Eschmann 2015]

* Persistent inequality due to:
  * horizontal stratification^[Lucas 2001; Van der Wefhorst and Mijs 2010]
  * structurally constrained decisions^[Brand & Xie, 2010; Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997; Grodsky & Riegle-Clumb, 2010]

Evidence supporting the second hypothesis includes Vocational Tracking as a particularly important case^[Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2013; Parker et al. 2016]

## Educational Stratification

Previous research estimating the impact of High School TVET:

* More vocationally oriented systems increase achievement gaps^[Bol and van de Werfhorst 2013]

* Students attending vocational schools decrease their performance^[Farías 2013, Farías and Carrasco 2012]

* Students attending vocational schools are affected in their expectations and self-esteem^[van Houtte et al. 2012, 2013]


TVET less studied in the context of adaptation of educational expectations^[Andrew and Hauser 2011; Karlson 2015]

## Institutional Context
### TVET in Chile

## Institutional Context
### 1998 Reform

## Institutional Context
### 1998 Reform

* The institutional design usually justified based on a trade-off between educational and labor-market outcomes

. . .

## Assignment mechanism

* In Chile, around 40% of students attend vocational high schools, that offer labor-oriented certificates(accounting, welding, social service, etc.)

## Assignment mechanism

* Students allowed to select program, but highly influenced by parental SES and education, and students' previous educational trajectories (achievement and expectations)
