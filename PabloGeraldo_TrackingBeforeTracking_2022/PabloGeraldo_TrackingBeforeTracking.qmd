# Framework

## Educational Stratification

<br>
The expansion of secondary education during the 20th century was accompanied by  contrasting  expectations. 

* Equalizing effect on attainment and skills^[Raftery and Hout 1993; Raudenbush and Eschmann 2015]

* Persistent inequality due to:
  * horizontal stratification^[Lucas 2001; Van der Wefhorst and Mijs 2010]
  * structurally constrained decisions^[Brand & Xie, 2010; Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997; Grodsky & Riegle-Clumb, 2010]

Evidence supporting the second hypothesis includes Vocational Tracking as a particularly important case^[Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2013; Parker et al. 2016]

Combined consequences of selection and track effects: **Schools as Sorting Machines**^[Domina et al. 2017]

## Educational Stratification

<br>
Previous research estimating the impact of High School TVET:

* More vocationally oriented systems increase achievement gaps^[Bol and van de Werfhorst 2013]

* Students attending vocational schools decrease their performance^[Farías 2013, Farías and Carrasco 2012]

* Students attending vocational schools are affected in their expectations and self-esteem^[van Houtte et al. 2012, 2013]


TVET less studied in the context of adaptation of educational expectations^[Andrew and Hauser 2011; Karlson 2015]

# Institutional Context

## TVET in Chile
### Institutional Context

<br>
Between 40 and 50% of students follow the vocational track:

* Less schools, but substantially bigger

* Some fluctuations in recent years

Around 70% of students expect to continue to higher education :

* Vast majority of them in College; fewer on Tertiary vocational education

* “Tracks” are not fixed/pipelined: one can go from vocational to general as long as you meet the academic requirements (GPA, Test scores)

* Around 40% enrolled in higher education at some point within 5 years. Much less completion.

## TVET in Chile
### Policy Context

<br>
Current research on horizontal stratification:

* Mostly focusing on school ownership/administration (public, private, and subsidized)
* Much less focus on vocational/general education differentiation

Lots of reforming initiatives, from the state and industry:

* Permeability?
* Vocational emphasis/dual training?

**The promise**: helping socioeconomically disadvantaged students in the labor market, minimizing the negative impact in educational trajectories

## This Study

<br>
Exploit the decoupling between institutional and curricular setting

* How does attending a vocational school affects

  * Students’ academic performance?
  * Students’ educational expectations?
  
Approach to the observational study

* Different assumptions: conditional ignorability and parallel trends
* Different estimation procedures: regression, matching, weighting
* Sensitivity analysis and falsification tests for possible violations of assumptions


Data from Chilean census of students (administrative + surveys): 4th grade (2007), 8th grade (2011), 10th grade (2013)


# Identification Strategy

## Research design

$\newcommand\indep{\perp\!\!\!\perp}$
The main problem one faces when trying to identify causal relationships with observational data: **maybe students in general and vocational schools are not comparable!**

**Approach**: conduct the study under different identification assumptions to deal with uncertainty about the "true causal model".

* **Selection on observables**: $\{Y_0, Y_1\} \indep \text{Vocational} ~\mid \text{ X}$

Where $X$ denotes students', parental and schools *observed* characteristics. Implemented using regression, matching and weighting for estimation.

* **Selection on time-invariant confounders**: $\{Y_0, Y_1\} \indep \text{Vocational} ~\mid \text{ X, U}$

Where $U$ denotes students' characteristics that are *unobserved* but constant over time. Implemented using difference-in-differences.


## Research design

* **Selection on time-varying confounding**

It is possible to deal with *observed* time-varying confounding using g-methods (Robins et al.), but *unobserved* time varying confounding is basically impossible to deal with. This is the main weakness of observational causal inference.

There are, however, ways to incorporate at least partially this possibility:

  + **Sensitivity Analysis**: How strong should unobserved confounding be to change our study's conclusions? Implemented using Rosenbaum bounds and robustness value (Cinelli and Hazlett)
  
  + **Falsification/Placebo Test**: Use a placebo outcome that should not be affected by the exposure of interest, but that one would expect to be affected by time-varying unobserved confounding. I used parental income and education by the time the outcome was measured.


## Assignment mechanism

* In Chile, around 40% of students attend vocational high schools, that offer labor-oriented certificates(accounting, welding, social service, etc.)

## Assignment mechanism

* Students allowed to select program, but highly influenced by parental SES and education, and students' previous educational trajectories (achievement and expectations)
