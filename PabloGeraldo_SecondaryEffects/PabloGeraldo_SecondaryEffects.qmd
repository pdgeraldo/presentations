# Framework

## Educational Stratification

<br> The expansion of secondary education during the 20th century was accompanied by contrasting expectations.

-   Equalizing effect on attainment and skills[^1]

-   Persistent inequality due to:

    -   horizontal stratification[^2]
    -   structurally constrained decisions[^3]

[^3]: Brand & Xie, 2010; Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997; Grodsky & Riegle-Clumb, 2010

Evidence supporting the second hypothesis includes vocational tracking as a particularly important case[^4]

## Educational Stratification

<br> Previous research estimating the impact of High School TVET:

-   More vocationally oriented systems increase achievement gaps[^9]

-   Students attending vocational schools decrease their performance[^10]

-   Students attending vocational schools are affected in their expectations and self-esteem[^11]

Vocational education less studied in the context of adaptation of educational expectations[^12]

# Institutional Context

## Vocational Schools in Chile

### Institutional Context

<br> Between 40 and 50% of students follow the vocational track:

-   Less schools, but substantially bigger

-   Some fluctuations in recent years

Around 70% of students expect to continue to higher education :

-   Vast majority of them in college; fewer on tertiary vocational education

-   "Tracks" are not fixed/pipelined: one can go from vocational to general as long as you meet the academic requirements (GPA, Test scores)

-   Around 40% enrolled in higher education at some point within 5 years, much less completion

## Vocational Schools in Chile

### Policy Context

<br> Current research on horizontal stratification:

-   Mostly focusing on school ownership/administration (public, private, and subsidized)
-   Much less focus on vocational/general education differentiation

Lots of reforming initiatives, from the state and industry:

-   Permeability?
-   Vocational emphasis/dual training?

**The promise**: helping socioeconomically disadvantaged students in the labor market, minimizing the negative impact in educational trajectories

## This Study

<br> Exploit the decoupling between institutional and curricular setting

-   How attending a vocational school affects

    -   Students' academic performance?
    -   Students' educational expectations?

Approach to the observational study

-   Different assumptions: conditional ignorability and parallel trends
-   Different estimation procedures: regression, matching, weighting
-   Sensitivity analysis and falsification tests for possible violations of assumptions

Data from Chilean census of students (administrative + surveys): 4th grade (2007), 8th grade (2011), 10th grade (2013)

# Identification Strategy

## Research design

$\newcommand\indep{\perp\!\!\!\perp}$ The main problem one faces when trying to identify causal relationships with observational data: **maybe students in general and vocational schools are not comparable!**

**Approach**: conduct the study under different identification assumptions to deal with uncertainty about the "true causal model".

-   **Selection on observables**: $\{Y_0, Y_1\} \indep \text{Vocational} ~\mid \text{ X}$

Where $X$ denotes students', parental and schools *observed* characteristics. Implemented using regression, matching and weighting for estimation.

-   **Selection on time-invariant confounders**: $\{Y_0, Y_1\} \indep \text{Vocational} ~\mid \text{ X, U}$

Where $U$ denotes students' characteristics that are *unobserved* but constant over time. Implemented using difference-in-differences.

## Research design

-   **Selection on time-varying confounding**

It is possible to deal with *observed* time-varying confounding using g-methods (Robins et al.), but *unobserved* time varying confounding is basically impossible to deal with. This is the main weakness of observational causal inference.

There are, however, ways to incorporate at least partially this possibility:

-   **Sensitivity Analysis**: How strong should unobserved confounding be to change our study's conclusions? Implemented using Rosenbaum bounds and robustness value (Cinelli and Hazlett)

-   **Falsification/Placebo Test**: Use a placebo outcome that should not be affected by the exposure of interest, but that one would expect to be affected by time-varying unobserved confounding. I used parental income and education by the time the outcome was measured.

## Assignment mechanism

-   In Chile, around 40% of students attend vocational high schools, that offer labor-oriented certificates (accounting, welding, social service, etc.)

## Assignment mechanism

-   Students allowed to select program, but highly influenced by parental SES and education, and students' previous educational trajectories (achievement and expectations)

## Discussion and Conclusions

<br> My findings generally support the hypotheses of a negative impact of attending vocational schools, **net of curricular differentiation**, on:

-   Students' academic achievement in mathematics: consistent across models and robust

-   Students' academic achievement: not consistent, less robust

-   Students' expectations: moderate, but robust

. . .

Promoting TVET for its labor market benefits, not considering other educational consequences, serves to the reproduction of social inequality

## Discussion and Conclusions

<br> As expected in an observational study, there are several limitations to this study:

-   Disagreement about potential omitted variable bias

-   Hard to benchmark sensitivity to unobserved confounding

Possible ways to deal with these shortcomings:

-   Use additional identification strategies, in a quasi-experimental framework (IV, school reform)

-   More intense study of the selection process or "assignment mechanism", for example, using (survey) experimental designs
