## A little bit about my research
. . .

<br> Social and educational stratification, causal inference and quantitative methods <br>

. . . 

<br>

### Dissertation

<br>

. . .

-   **Chapter 1**: Moving beyond templates of empirical research


-   **Chapter 2**: Tracking before tracking? Effects of vocational high schools on students performance and expectations

 
-   [**Chapter 3**: Secondary effects of tuition-free college in Chile on students' trajectories]{.fragment .highlight-blue}


# Motivation


## Higher education funding is a contentious matter

<br>

. . . 

- Who has to pay for it?
- Increasing costs, diminishing public funding
- Skyrocketing student debt, debt relief and forgiveness 
- Implications for inequality and mobility

. . .

**Are these policies progressive or regressive?**

. . .

- Who would benefit from expding college funding? Who is "at risk"?
- Tradeoffs between funding higher education versus other levels
- Who benefits *more* from college?

## Why *secondary effects*?

<br>

. . .

College funding policies usually intended to benefit college students

. . .

- But there might be sizable and *unintended* effects on other populations
  
. . .

- One of those potentially affected groups is *secondary students*

. . . 

- One outcome in particular, are their decisions of continuing schooling or not (*secondary effects* of social origin in some stratification research)



# Inequalities in educational trajectories

## Status attainment, rational choice, and beyond

<br>

Two classic approaches to study inequality in students' trajectories:

  - Status attainment models (Wisconsin)
  - Rational choice models (Boudon)
  
Both would predict adaptation on students' decisions in response to:
  
  - Changes in expectations
  - Changes in costs and probability of success
  
. . .

Mare (2006) call for transition models to move beyond:

. . .

> “asociological approaches in which educational stratification results from information processing and rational calculation by atomized families and individuals”, focusing instead on “a broader set of concerns about the multiple interdependent decision makers at various institutional levels who may be responsible for levels and variations in educational attainment”


## Predicting student persistence

<br>

Researchers in education usually distinguish between:

  - Status or individual characteristics, mostly unmodifiable
  - (Mostly alterable) risk factors, in control of institutions
  
. . . 
  
Somewhat related: "pull out" vs "push out"

. . . 

- Lifecourse and disruptive events
- Family, neighborhood, and student factors
- School experiences 
  - teacher- and peer-victimization
  - exclusionary discipline
  
. . .

**Are we getting prediction when we want causastion?**
