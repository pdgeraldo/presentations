# Motivation


<br> The expansion of secondary education during the 20th century was accompanied by contrasting expectations.

-   Equalizing effect on attainment and skills[^1]

-   Persistent inequality due to:

    -   horizontal stratification[^2]
    -   structurally constrained decisions[^3]

[^3]: Brand & Xie, 2010; Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997; Grodsky & Riegle-Clumb, 2010

Evidence supporting the second hypothesis includes vocational tracking as a particularly important case[^4]
