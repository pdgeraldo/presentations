![](img/GoogleTrends_GratuidadBecas.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

-   Announced in 2015, implemented 2016
-   Initially 30 institutions
-   Public and non-profit
-   Students in lowest 50% of income


Following year: More institutions (technical) and coverage (60% lowest income)

## Why focus on *secondary students*?

College funding policies usually intended to benefit college students, but

. . .

-   There might be sizable *unintended* effects on other populations


-   One of those potentially affected groups is *secondary students*


-   Their decisions of continuing schooling or not directly affects *who is at risk* of going to college

. . .

**What do we know about anticipatory effects?**

. . .

- Shock to costs and expectations, may be expected to affect students earlier in their trajectories

- Previous research: expectations, dropout, and risk behaviors

## Higher education funding is a contentious matter

<br>

. . .

-   Who has to pay for it?
-   Increasing costs, diminishing public funding
-   Skyrocketing student debt, debt relief and forgiveness
-   Implications for inequality and mobility

. . .

**Are these policies progressive or regressive?**

. . .

-   Who would benefit from expanding college funding? Who is "at risk"?
-   Trade-offs between funding higher education versus other levels
-   Who benefits *more* from college?



## What to expect from funding reforms?

<br>

How to modify students' behaviors?

. . .

Traditionally, emphasis on [information]{.fragment .highlight-red}


-   Information only: small and inconsistent effects


-   Information + counseling: better


-   Financial aid: even better


-   [Certainty of funding to rule them all]{.fragment .highlight-red} (Burland et al., 2023, Dynarski et al., 2021)





# Data and Methods {background-color="#00a191"}

## Chilean education system

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Secondary education**

*   Highly segregated [three-tier system]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    -   **Ownership**: private, subsidized, public
    -   **Track**: academic, vocational, mixed

*   Funded by quasi-voucher (attendance-based but preferential subsidy)

*   Student dropout still important issue
    -   Especially from 8th to 9th grade
    -   Socioeconomic and gender disparities remain
    -   [Huge but temporary spike due to 2011 mobilizations]{.fragment .highlight-blue}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Tertiary education**

-   Self-financing institutions (tuition)
-   Private and public institutions competing for public funding
-   Mostly private enrollment
-   Among highest private spending in OECD

## Data and variables

<br>

**Administrative data 2009-2020:**

-   Enrollment data (April)
-   Promotion data (December)
-   Students in regular system


**Key variables:**

-   Treatment: exposure to tuition-free college (pre/post 2016)

-   Primary outcome: student dropout

-   Subgroups: sex, region, grade, school track and ownership


## Identification and Estimation

# Motivation {background-color="#00a191"}

## Higher education funding is a contentious matter

<br>

. . .

-   Who has to pay for it?
-   Increasing costs, diminishing public funding
-   Skyrocketing student debt, debt relief and forgiveness
-   Implications for inequality and mobility

. . .

**Are these policies progressive or regressive?**

. . .

-   Who would benefit from expding college funding? Who is "at risk"?
-   Tradeoffs between funding higher education versus other levels
-   Who benefits *more* from college?

## Who benefits from college funding expansion?

<br>

. . .

College funding policies usually intended to benefit college students

. . .

-   But there might be sizable and *unintended* effects on other populations

. . .

-   One of those potentially affected groups is *high school students*

. . .

-   In particular, are their decisions of continuing schooling or not affected by funding availability for *future* educational transitions?

# Inequalities in educational trajectories {background-color="#00a191"}

## Status attainment, rational choice, and beyond

Two classic approaches to study inequality in students' trajectories:

-   Status attainment models (Wisconsin)
-   Rational choice models (Boudon)

Both would predict adaptation on students' decisions in response to:

-   Changes in expectations
-   Changes in costs and probability of success

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
## Mare (2006) call for transition models to move beyond:
"approaches in which educational stratification results from information processing and rational calculation by atomized families and individuals", focusing instead on "a broader set of concerns about the multiple interdependent decision makers at various institutional levels who may be responsible for levels and variations in educational attainment"
:::



## Predicting student persistence

<br>

Researchers in education usually distinguish between:

-   Status or individual characteristics, mostly unmodifiable
-   (Mostly alterable) risk factors, in control of institutions

. . .

Somewhat related: "pull out" vs "push out"

. . .

-   Lifecourse and disruptive events
-   Family, neighborhood, and student factors
-   School experiences
    -   teacher- and peer-victimization
    -   exclusionary discipline

. . .

**Are we getting prediction when we want causation?**

## From risk factors to policy and interventions

<br>

Experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation of policies and interventions modifying student behavior

. . .

-   High school interventions

-   Higher education interventions

Traditionally, emphasis on *information*:

. . .

-   Information only: small and inconsistent effects

-   Information + counseling: better

. . .

-   Financial aid: even better

. . .

-   Certainty of funding to rule them all ( Burland et al., 2023, Dynarski et al., 2021)

# What about anticipatory effects? {background-color="#00a191"}

## Anticipatory effects of higher education funding

Both status attainment and rational choice models would predict that students' behavior might change in anticipation to future transitions:

-   Shock of expectations
-   Shock of funding and costs

:::{.callout-note}
## Surprisingly little research actually testing this idea. Some examples:

-   Cowan (2011): lowering college costs is associated with less risky sexual and drinking behavior in secondary students

-   Venkataramani et al. (2019): bans of affirmative action increased risky behaviors among affected adolescents

-   Koohi (2017): lowering costs of college for undocumented students decreased dropout rates and teen pregnancy

-   Cáceres-Delpiano et al. (2018): access to credit decreased dropout and increased expectations in Chile

# Institutional context: Chilean education system {background-color="#00a191"}

## Secondary education: Setting

<br> Organization and funding designed during the military dictatorship (1973-1990), reformed during the 90s:

. . .

-   Highly segregated in a three-tier system

    -   Ownership: private, subsidized, public
    -   Track: academic, vocational, mixed

. . .

-   Funded by quasi-voucher

-   Depends on attendance

-   Modified in 2008, preferential subsidy

## Secondary education: Outcomes

High school dropout still an important issue in Latin America

. . .

-   In Chile, primary school graduation almost universal for three decades

-   In secondary education, still important:

    -   Especially from 8th to 9th grade
    -   Socioeconomic and gender disparities remain

. . .

*Huge* but *temporary* spike due to student mobilization in 2011

## Tertiary education: Setting

<br> Organization and funding designed during the military dictatorship (1973-1990), reformed during the 90s:

-   Self financing institutions (tuition)
-   Competition for public funding (AFD and AFI)
-   Mostly private enrollment
-   Struggle to regulate for-profit and quality

. . .

## Tertiary education: Tuition-free college


<br>

Mobilization was instrumental to building a new coalition of old and new parties

. . .

In 2013, student leaders elected for the parliament

In 2014, the socialist Michelle Bachelet won her (second) presidential election with 62% of votes

-   Reforms and tuition-free college in the campaign

-   Tuition-free college announced (*almost* by surprise) on 2015

## Tertiary education

### Tuition-free college

<br> Bachelet speech (21st May, 2015)

> "The main goal we have established for ourselves in relation to higher education is achieving quality and tuition-free education for everyone. (. . . ) many times scholarships are not enough to cover all fees, so the most vulnerable students and the middle class have to take on excessive debt to pay for the difference. This is why, moving towards our commitment of having tuition-free higher education for the 70% most vulnerable students at the end of my presidential period, starting in 2016 we will guarantee for the most vulnerable 60% of students enrolled in technical education, accredited and non-for-profit professional schools, or traditioinal universities, to have complete and effective tuition-free education, without scholarships or loans"

The policy started in 2016:

-   30 institutions
-   Public and non-profit
-   Students in the lowest 50% of income

. . .

Following year:

-   more institutions, especially technical
-   expansion to 60% lowest income

## Conclusions

<br> The introduction of tuition-free college in 2016 seems to have benefited high school students, lowering their dropout rates:

-   As expected, the effect is more pronounced for the most disadvantaged students

. . .

In other outcomes (retention/promotion, school abandonment, track choice) there is no clear effect of the policy.

. . .

The results highlight the importance of focusing on *broader* impacts of education funding policies, affecting our equity considerations:

-   Policies themselves can modify their *at risk* population

. . .

Future research should address the trajectories of the *induced* students, beyond high school
