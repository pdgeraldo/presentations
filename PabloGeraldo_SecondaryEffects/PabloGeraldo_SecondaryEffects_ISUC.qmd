## Tuition-free college reform (2015/2016)

![](img/GoogleTrends_GratuidadBecas.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

-   Announced in 2015, implemented 2016
-   Initially 30 institutions
-   Public and non-profit
-   Students in lowest 50% of income


Following year: More institutions (technical) and coverage (60% lowest income)

## Higher education funding is a contentious matter
  
  <br>
  
  . . .

-   Who has to pay for it?
  -   Increasing costs, diminishing public funding
-   Skyrocketing student debt, debt relief and forgiveness
-   Implications for inequality and mobility

. . .

**Are these policies progressive or regressive?**
  
  . . .

-   Who would benefit from expanding college funding? Who is "at risk"?
  -   Trade-offs between funding higher education versus other levels
-   Who benefits *more* from college?
  
  
  
## What to expect from funding reforms?
  
  <br>
  
  How to modify students' behaviors?

. . .

Traditionally, emphasis on [information]{.fragment .highlight-red}


-   Information only: small and inconsistent effects


-   Information + counseling: better


-   Financial aid: even better


-   [Certainty of funding to rule them all]{.fragment .highlight-red} (Burland et al., 2023, Dynarski et al., 2021)




## Why focus on *secondary students*?

College funding policies usually intended to benefit college students, but

. . .

-   There might be sizable *unintended* effects on other populations


-   One of those potentially affected groups is *secondary students*
  
  
  -   Their decisions of continuing schooling or not directly affects *who is at risk* of going to college

. . .

**What do we know about anticipatory effects?**
  
  . . .

- Shock to costs and expectations, may be expected to affect students earlier in their trajectories

- Previous research: expectations, dropout, and risk behaviors

# Data and Methods {background-color="#00a191"}

## Chilean education system

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Secondary education**

*   Highly segregated [three-tier system]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    -   **Ownership**: private, subsidized, public
    -   **Track**: academic, vocational, mixed

*   Funded by quasi-voucher (attendance-based but preferential subsidy)

*   Student dropout still important issue
    -   Especially from 8th to 9th grade
    -   Socioeconomic and gender disparities remain
    -   [Huge but temporary spike due to 2011 mobilizations]{.fragment .highlight-blue}
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
**Tertiary education**

-   Self-financing institutions (tuition)
-   Private and public institutions competing for public funding
-   Mostly private enrollment
-   Among highest private spending in OECD

## Data and variables

<br>

**Administrative data 2009-2020:**

-   Enrollment data (April)
-   Promotion data (December)
-   Students in regular system


**Key variables:**

-   Treatment: exposure to tuition-free college (pre/post 2016)

-   Primary outcome: student dropout

-   Subgroups: sex, region, grade, school track and ownership



## Identification

$$
\underbrace{\color{blue}{E[Y_1|Post=1]}]}_{\text{observed}} - \underbrace{\color{red}{E[Y_0|Post=1]}}_{\text{missing}}
$$

. . .


**Single-group event study (aka pre/post)** 

$$
E[Y_0|Post=0] \approx E[Y_0|Post=1]
$$

. . .

**With comparison group**

$$
E[Y_0|Post=1, Public]-E[Y_0|Post=0, Public] =
$$

$$
E[Y_0|Post=1, Private]-E[Y_0|Post=0, Private]
$$

## Conclusions

<br> The introduction of tuition-free college in 2016 seems to have benefited high school students, lowering their dropout rates:

-   As expected, the effect is more pronounced for the most disadvantaged students

. . .

In other outcomes (retention/promotion, school abandonment, track choice) there is no clear effect of the policy.

. . .

The results highlight the importance of focusing on *broader* impacts of education funding policies, affecting our equity considerations:

-   Policies themselves can modify their *at risk* population

. . .

Future research should address the trajectories of the *induced* students, beyond high school




# Dealing with population selection {background-color="#00a191"}

## Causal inference 101 (again!)

To think *causally*, we need to go [beyond]{style="color:red;"} what we can observe. We need to hypothesize about possible worlds (*what if*s)!

. . .

To do this, let's *postulate* the existence of [potential outcomes]{style="color:red;"}

<br>

Let's start with some definitions:

. . .

$Y$ is the outcome variable *as we observe it*

$D$ is the variable whose effect we want to study (treatment, exposure)

$Y_d$ is the potential outcome when we [**set**]{.fragment .highlight-red} $D=d$. For example, when $D \in \{0,1\}$:

-   $Y_1$ is the potential outcome under "treatment"

-   $Y_0$ is the potential outcome under "control"

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Causal estimands

The first thing that potential outcomes allow us to do is to formalize the causal effects we may want to estimate.

Some frequently invoked estimands are the following: 

<br>

[[Individual treatment effect]{style="color:blue;"}
$$ITE = \tau_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$$]{.fragment .fade-in}

. . .

[Average treatment effect]{style="color:blue;"}
$$
ATE = E[\tau_i] = E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}]$$ $$= E[Y_{1i}] - E[Y_{0i}]
$$



## What is your estimand?

<br>

::: callout-tip
"The first step of quantitative empirical research—whether descriptive, predictive, or causal—is to state a theoretical estimand that exists outside of the statistical model. We propose that the goal is often a quantity involving two components: a unit-specific quantity subscripted by $i$ aggregated over a target population of units." (Lundberg et al.)

## The ladder of causation 

:::{.panel-tabset}

## Association

| Estimand | Activity | Field/Discipline | Questions | Example |
| ---- | --- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| $\mathbf{P(Y \vert X)}$ | Seeing, Observing | Stats, Machine Learning | *What would I believe about Y if I see X?* | What is the expected income of a college graduate in a given field? |

## Interventions
| Estimand | Activity | Field/Discipline | Questions | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| $\mathbf{P(Y \vert do(x))}$ | Doing, Intervening | Experiments, Policy evaluation | *What would happen with Y if I change X?* | How would income levels change in response to college expansion? |

## Counterfactuals

| Estimand | Activity | Field/Discipline | Questions | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| $\mathbf{P(Y_x \vert x',y')}$ | Imagining, Retrospecting | Structural Models | *What would have happened with Y have I done X instead of X'? Why?* | What would have my parents' income been, have they graduated from college, given that they didn't go?|

## The issue

* Non-existing outcomes (Lundberg and Cho)

![](img/Lundberg_Cho_nonexistent.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## The issue

* Phantom counterfactuals (Slough)

![](img/PhantomCounterfactuals.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## Approach 1: Principal Stratification

Define an intermediate variable ($S$), defining the outcome existence. This variable is itself a *potential outcome*: $S_d \in \{0,1\}$ defines the existence (1) or not (0) of the outcome under treatment $d$. 

It can be taken as an outcome itself, and defining the *latent* subgroup of interest (aka *Survivor* causal effect)

* Used in the modern IV framework to target the *compliers*

* Can be identified under conditional exchangeability, monotonicity, or mean dominance

## Approach 3: Counterfactual Strata

Study interventions that affect the outcome simultaneously through increasing reach (for example, testing or screening), but with outcomes measured only among the reached

Crucially, both the outcome and the target population are subject to missingness!

## Why are existing frameworks problematic?

* Individual-first vs population-first approaches to causal inference (aggregation issues)

* Not precise about intervention vs counterfactual effects

* Require cross-world independence assumptions (like to natural mediation)

* Overlook model-specification issues (see Heckman selection example)
