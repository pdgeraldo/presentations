# Why should we care about causal inference? {background-color="#00a191"}

## 

<br>
The social sciences are experimenting what some authors have called a "credibility revolution" (Angrist and Pischke, 2010), an "identification revolution" (Morgan, 2016), or simply a "causal revolution" (Pearl and MacKenzie, 2018)

. . .

In artificial intelligence/ML, causality have been deemed [**"the next frontier"**](https://phys.org/news/2019-02-causal-disentanglement-frontier-ai.html) and [**"the next most important thing"**](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/causality-the-next-most-important-thing-in-ai-ml)

. . .

The enormous progress in the last decades has been facilitated by the development of mathematical frameworks that provide researchers with a precise language to handle causal questions: [Potential Outcomes]{.fragment .highlight-red} and the [Structural Causal Model]{.fragment .highlight-red}


# But, really, why should *I* care? {background-color="#00a191"}

## What is your estimand?

Researchers, at least social scientists, tend to formalize their effect of interest as **regression coefficients** (i.e., their hypothesis are formulated within a statistical model)

[[**This is too restrictive!**]()]{.fragment .fade-in}

. . . 

Potential outcomes offer a way to formalize what we mean by a *causal effect* outside any statistical model. Graphical models provides a way to formalize our *assumptions* without parametric restrictions.

. . .

This allows us to clearly separate *what do we want* (a certain **estimand**), what needs to be true so we get what we want (**identifying assumptions**), the statistical machinery to transform data into an answer for our question (an **estimator**), and the particular answer we get (our empirical **estimate**).

Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart (2021) discuss this point in great detail. Absolutely worth reading! Ungated version [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ba67n/).

# The anatomy of OVB {background-color="#00a191"}

## A familiar example

Let's assume we want to estimate the causal effect of having a college degree ($X$) on income ($Y$), and we have observational data on these variables.

The unconditional association between $X$ and $Y$ is not the true causal effect, as it it *biased* (or [*confounded*]{.fragment .highlight-red}) by other variables $W$ such that:

  - They affect who gets a college degree ($W \rightarrow X$), and
  
  - They affect the income of individuals ($W \rightarrow Y$)
  
  
Common examples of such variables in the literature are family background and ability.

The omitted variable bias problem arises when we either [*do not know*]{.fragment .highlight-red} the appropriate $W$s, or knowing them, we have not [*measured*]{.fragment .highlight-red} them.

***When is omitting variables not problem?***

OVB is a *causal* concept. If you care about associations or predictions, then it is not an issue!

# What to do? {background-color="#00a191"}

## Wrong answer
### Include whatever and as much as you have!

![](img/ovb_authors.jpg){.center}

## Deal with imbalance ($\delta$) *by design*

:::{.r-stack}

:::{.fragment}
**RCT**: An ideal approach would be to randomly assign who gets the treatment of interest and who doesn't. This breaks the $W \rightarrow X$ link

**Quasi-Exp**: Sometimes, it is possible to find an event or sub-population in which the treatment is *as-good-as-random*. In theory, this should also deals with $\delta$

![](img/ovb_iv.svg){.fragment .center}
:::


![](img/ovb_rct.png){.fragment .center}

:::

## Benchmarking and sensitivity

Instead of assuming away OVB, we can try to bound the estimated treatment effect under plausible assumptions around its magnitude

:::{.r-stack}

:::{.fragment}
**Worst-case bounds:** Assume a $W$ perfectly predicting $Y$ (strongest possible $\gamma$), and ask how much the imbalance ($\delta$) should be to change our conclusions
  
**Simulate:** Use a range of $\gamma \times \delta$ values to simulate how the results would change for a range of values of OVB

**Benchmark:** Use included variables to benchmark the magnitude of the possibly excluded factors
:::

![](img/ovb_cinelli_hazlett.png){.fragment .center}

:::

## When is OVB an issue?

* Ask yourself if you're trying to get a causal relationship

  - Define your treatment with enough detail so you can ask, [*what factors affecting both the outcome and who gets the treatment*]{.fragment .highlight-blue} may be missing
  
  - Bias is always [*relative to a target quantity*]{.fragment .highlight-blue}


* Remember: there is always omission, but it's not always a problem!
  
  - **Outcome**: efficiency loss, but not necessarily bias
  
  - **Treatment-related**: it may even be better (bias amplification)
  
  - [Both? Danger zone!]{.fragment .highlight-red}

* Bias *relative* to a target quantity!




# Identification strategies {background-color="#00a191"}

## Identification strategies: a short tour

Identification strategies are well-known set of assumptions that are sufficient for the causal interpretation of certain estimators:

:::{.callout-tip}
## Imbens (2019)
*Partly as a result of the focus on empirical examples the econometrics literature has developed a small number of canonical settings where researchers view the specific causal models and associated statistical methods as well-established and understood. These causal models correspond to what is nowadays often referred to as* identification strategies

## Is there a ladder of identification strategies?

In general, it is assumed that the stronger the assumptions, the less credible an identification strategy would be

We would prefere experiments (the so-called *gold standard*) and, in the lack of experiments, we would prefer strategies in which our assumptions hold **by design**

Designs in which there is an **exogenous** source of variation in the treatment status (like IV, RDD, quasi-experiments in general) are considered more plausible

However, is there a natural hierarchy of identification strategies that can tell us, *a priori*, which assumptions are more credible in empirical applications?

Do empirical applications corresponds to the labels that we use to describe a given research design? Any thoughts?

## Debates in applied research

. . . 

:::{.callout-tip}
## B. G. Cochran (cited in Rosenbaum, 1995)
*About 20 years ago, when asked in a meeting what can be done in observational studies to clarify the step from association to causation, Sir Ronald Fisher replied: 'Make your theories elaborate.' The reply puzzled me at first, since by Occam's razor, the advice usually given is to make theories as simple as is consistent with known data. What Sir Ronald meant, as subsequent discussion showed, was that when constructing a causal hypothesis one should envisage as many different consequences of its truth as possible, and plan observational studies to discover whether each of these is found to hold.*
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Jason Abaluck (cited in Imbens, 2019)
*No one should ever write down a 100 variable DAG and do inference based on that. That would be an insane approach because the analysis would be totally impenetrable. Develop a research design where that 100 variable DAG trivially reduces to a familiar problem (e.g. IV!)*

## Higher education funding is a contentious matter

<br>

. . .

**Who has to pay for it?**

. . .

  -   Increasing costs, diminishing public funding
  -   Skyrocketing student debt, debt relief and forgiveness
  -   Implications for inequality and mobility

. . .

**Are these policies progressive or regressive?**

. . .

-   Trade-off between funding higher education versus other levels
-   Who benefits *more* from college?
-   Who would benefit from expanding college funding? 
-   [Who is "at risk"?]{.fragment .highligth-blue}



## Why focus on *secondary students*?

College funding policies usually intended to benefit college students, but

. . .

-   There might be sizable *unintended* effects on other populations


-   One of those potentially affected groups is *secondary students*


-   Their decisions of continuing schooling or not directly affects *who is at risk* of going to college

. . .

**What do we know about anticipatory effects?**

. . .

As a shock to costs and expectations, expanding higher education funding may be expected to affect students trajectories even earlier in their trajectories.

Previous research has shown high school students responding to (expansions/cuts to) college funding: expectations, dropout, and risk behaviors

## Conclusions

<br> The introduction of tuition-free college in 2016 seems to have benefited high school students, lowering their dropout rates:

-   As expected, the effect is more pronounced for the most disadvantaged students

. . .

In other outcomes (retention/promotion, school abandonment, track choice) there is no clear effect of the policy.

. . .

The results highlight the importance of focusing on *broader* impacts of education funding policies, affecting our equity considerations:

-   Policies themselves can modify their *at risk* population
