# A little bit about my research

## 

I am a social scientist working across disciplines to understand social stratification and inequality, with a focus on the unintended consequences of institutional design and policy reforms.

Methodologically, my expertise relates to causal inference with observational and (quasi-) experimental data, including flexible estimation using machine learning methods.

-   **Academic background**
    -   Formally: PhD in Sociology and MS in Statistics (UCLA)
    -   Informally: Collaborations and training across Sociology, PoliSci, Statistics, Epidemiology, Anthropology, Complexity Science, and adding... 

. . .

-   **Affiliations**
    -   Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science (Oxford)
    -   Practical Causal Inference Lab (UCLA)
    -   Social Data Science Lab (UCLA)



# Future plans {background-color="#00a191"}

##

My future research covers three main areas:

* **Social stratification and inequality**

  - Mostly education and labor markets
  - Tuition-free policy: other outcomes, cohort follow-up, other contexts
  
* **Quantitative methods**

  - Causal inference beyond toy models
  - (Why not) prediction using LLMs
  
* **Conceptual clarification**

  - Microsimulation: from ABMs to MARL to LLM agents
  - What is wrong with social genomics
  - Human vs machine variability and representations
  
  
## Social stratification and inequality

International collaboration with scholars in PUC-Chile

Focus: unintended consequences of policy reforms and institutional designs

Next steps: applying for funding from Chilean institutions

## Quantitative methods

International collaboration with scholars from UCLA and Oxford

Focus: developing methods for credible causal inference in complex scenarios

Next steps: Grant applications for causal inference and population dynamics

## Conceptual clarification

International collaboration with Oxford, SFI, and Purdue


This is a bit of a side quest, but (maybe) the most relevant

* Going back to fundamental assumptions in a non-procedural way

* Response to hyped research areas and asking for clarification


I would appreciate leads on how to get this funded! Otherwise, it is still a personal project that I am pursuing with like-minded colleagues from across institutions.
