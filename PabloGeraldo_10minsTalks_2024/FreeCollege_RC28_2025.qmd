## Tuition-free college reform (2015/2016)

![](img/GoogleTrends_GratuidadBecas.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

-   Announced in 2015, implemented 2016
-   Initially 30 institutions
-   Public and non-profit
-   Students in lowest 50% of income


Following year: More institutions (technical) and coverage (60% lowest income)

## Why focus on *secondary students*?

College funding policies usually intended to benefit college students, but

. . .

-   There might be sizable *unintended* effects on other populations


-   One of those potentially affected groups is *secondary students*


-   Their decisions of continuing schooling or not directly affects *who is at risk* of going to college

. . .

**What do we know about anticipatory effects?**

. . .

- Shock to costs and expectations, may be expected to affect students earlier in their trajectories

- Previous research: expectations, dropout, and risk behaviors

## Higher education funding is a contentious matter


**Who has to pay for it?**

**Are these policies progressive or regressive?**

. . .

* Who is "at risk" of the next transition?

* Phantom counterfactuals (Slough)

## What to expect from funding reforms?

<br>

How to modify students' behaviors?

. . .

Traditionally, emphasis on [information]{.fragment .highlight-red}


-   Information only: small and inconsistent effects


-   Information + counseling: better


-   Financial aid: even better


-   [Certainty of funding to rule them all]{.fragment .highlight-red} (Burland et al., 2023, Dynarski et al., 2021)




# Data and Methods {background-color="#00a191"}

## Chilean education system

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Secondary education**

*   Highly segregated [three-tier system]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    -   **Ownership**: private, subsidized, public
    -   **Track**: academic, vocational, mixed

*   Funded by quasi-voucher (attendance-based but preferential subsidy)

*   Student dropout still important issue
    -   Especially from 8th to 9th grade
    -   Socioeconomic and gender disparities remain
    -   [Huge but temporary spike due to 2011 mobilizations]{.fragment .highlight-blue}
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
**Tertiary education**

-   Self-financing institutions (tuition)
-   Private and public institutions competing for public funding
-   Mostly private enrollment
-   Among highest private spending in OECD

## Data and variables

<br>

**Administrative data 2009-2020:**

-   Enrollment data (April)
-   Promotion data (December)
-   Students in regular system


**Key variables:**

-   Treatment: exposure to tuition-free college (pre/post 2016)

-   Primary outcome: student dropout

-   Subgroups: sex, region, grade, school track and ownership


## Identification and Estimation

$$
\underbrace{\color{blue}{E[Y_1|Post=1]}]}_{\text{observed}} - \underbrace{\color{red}{E[Y_0|Post=1]}}_{\text{missing}}
$$

. . .


**Single-group event study (aka pre/post)** 

$$
E[Y_0|Post=0] \approx E[Y_0|Post=1]
$$

. . .

**With comparison group**

$$
E[Y_0|Post=1, Public]-E[Y_0|Post=0, Public] =
$$

$$
E[Y_0|Post=1, Private]-E[Y_0|Post=0, Private]
$$

## Conclusions

<br> The introduction of tuition-free college in 2016 seems to have benefited high school students, lowering their dropout rates:

-   As expected, the effect is more pronounced for the most disadvantaged students

. . .

In other outcomes (retention/promotion, school abandonment, track choice) there is no clear effect of the policy.

. . .

The results highlight the importance of focusing on *broader* impacts of education funding policies, affecting our equity considerations:

-   Policies themselves can modify their *at risk* population

. . .

Future research should address the trajectories of the *induced* students, beyond high school
