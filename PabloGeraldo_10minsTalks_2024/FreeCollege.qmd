## Higher education funding is a contentious matter

<br>

. . .

**Who has to pay for it?**

. . .

  -   Increasing costs, diminishing public funding
  -   Skyrocketing student debt, debt relief and forgiveness
  -   Implications for inequality and mobility

. . .

**Are these policies progressive or regressive?**

. . .

-   Trade-off between funding higher education versus other levels
-   Who benefits *more* from college?
-   Who would benefit from expanding college funding? 
-   [Who is "at risk"?]{.fragment .highligth-blue}



## Why focus on *secondary students*?

College funding policies usually intended to benefit college students, but

. . .

-   There might be sizable *unintended* effects on other populations


-   One of those potentially affected groups is *secondary students*


-   Their decisions of continuing schooling or not directly affects *who is at risk* of going to college

. . .

**What do we know about anticipatory effects?**

. . .

As a shock to costs and expectations, expanding higher education funding may be expected to affect students trajectories even earlier in their trajectories.

Previous research has shown high school students responding to (expansions/cuts to) college funding: expectations, dropout, and risk behaviors

## What to expect from funding reforms?

<br>

(Quasi-)experimental evaluations of interventions to modify student behavior during secondary and tertiary education:

. . .

Traditionally, emphasis on [information]{.fragment .highlight-red}

. . .

-   Information only: small and inconsistent effects

-   Information + counseling: better

. . .

-   Financial aid: even better

. . .

-   [Certainty of funding to rule them all]{.fragment .highlight-red} (Burland et al., 2023, Dynarski et al., 2021)



# Institutional context  {background-color="#00a191"}

## Chilean education system

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Secondary education**

*   Highly segregated [three-tier system]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    -   **Ownership**: private, subsidized, public
    -   **Track**: academic, vocational, mixed

*   Funded by quasi-voucher (attendance-based but preferential subsidy)

*   Student dropout still important issue
    -   Especially from 8th to 9th grade
    -   Socioeconomic and gender disparities remain
    -   [Huge but temporary spike due to 2011 mobilizations]{.fragment .highlight-blue}
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
**Tertiary education**

-   Self-financing institutions (tuition)
-   Private and public institutions competing for public funding
-   Mostly private enrollment
-   Among highest private spending in OECD

## Tuition-free college reform (2015/2016)

![](img/GoogleTrends_GratuidadBecas.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

-   Announced in 2015, implemented 2016
-   Initially 30 institutions
-   Public and non-profit
-   Students in lowest 50% of income


Following year: More institutions (technical) and coverage (60% lowest income)

# Data and Methods {background-color="#00a191"}

## Data and variables

<br>

**Administrative data 2009-2020:**

-   Enrollment data (April)
-   Promotion data (December)
-   Students in regular system


**Key variables:**

-   Treatment: exposure to tuition-free college (pre/post 2016)

-   Primary outcome: student dropout

-   Secondary outcomes: grade retention, school abandonment, track choice

-   Subgroups: sex, region, grade, school track and ownership


## Identification and Estimation

$$
\underbrace{\color{blue}{E[Y_1|Post=1]}]}_{\text{observed}} - \underbrace{\color{red}{E[Y_0|Post=1]}}_{\text{missing}}
$$

. . .


**Single-group event study (aka pre/post)** 

$$
E[Y_0|Post=0] \approx E[Y_0|Post=1]
$$

. . .

**With comparison group**

$$
E[Y_0|Post=1, Public]-E[Y_0|Post=0, Public] =
$$

$$
E[Y_0|Post=1, Private]-E[Y_0|Post=0, Private]
$$

## Conclusions

<br> The introduction of tuition-free college in 2016 seems to have benefited high school students, lowering their dropout rates:

-   As expected, the effect is more pronounced for the most disadvantaged students

. . .

In other outcomes (retention/promotion, school abandonment, track choice) there is no clear effect of the policy.

. . .

The results highlight the importance of focusing on *broader* impacts of education funding policies, affecting our equity considerations:

-   Policies themselves can modify their *at risk* population

. . .

Future research should address the trajectories of the *induced* students, beyond high school


# Future plans {background-color="#00a191"}

##

My future research covers three main areas:

* **Social stratification and inequality**

  - Mostly education and labor markets
  - Tuition-free policy: other outcomes, cohort follow-up, other contexts
  
* **Quantitative methods**

  - Causal inference beyond toy models
  - (Why not) prediction using LLMs
  
* **Conceptual clarification**

  - Microsimulation: from ABMs to MARL to LLM agents
  - What is wrong with social genomics
  - Human vs machine variability and representations
