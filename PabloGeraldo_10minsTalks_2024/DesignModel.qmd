## Design-based vs model-based frameworks

[Design-based]{style="color:blue;"} and [model-based]{style="color:green;"} inferences are alternative conceptual frameworks for addressing statistical questions for many types of investigations:

. . .

* Surveys and sampling

. . .

* Experimental allocation of treatments

. . .

* Observational studies

### [Design-based analysis]{style="color:blue;"}
***(What we can control, we should control!)***

* Only assumption is random selection of units (treatment, sample) in the study
design [(plus perfect implementation of the design!)]{.fragment .highlight-red}

* We use the fact that the only thing we can control is the design of our study

* Strong internal validity and controlled error probability

### [Model-based analysis]{style="color:green;"}
***(What we cannot control, we should model!)***

* Requires assumptions external to the study design

* Posits probability distributions and a data-generating process (DGP)

* Validity of the claim is model dependent (remember George Box!)

## When use one of another?

<br>

Traditionally, the distinction between design-based and model-based analysis in surveys has been motivated by different [levels of control and knowledge]{.fragment .highlight-red} that researchers have over the data collection process.

The distinction also depends on what [sources of uncertainty]{.fragment .highlight-red} we want to account for when conducting inference!

. . .

# Be aware!

Design-based does not necessarily imply model-free. 

Model-based does not necessarily imply design-lacking.

We should aim for model-aware and design-aware inferences!

## Beyond ideal types

In practice, and increasingly, design-based considerations are necessary but not sufficient to deal with complex data collection scenarios and informative attrition and non-response. 

* Principle 1: If you can, use your understanding in the design stage

* Principle 2: When implementation departs from design, model how so! 

* Principle 3a: If you don't control the design, be explicit about your model

* Principle 3b: If you know about the design, bring that into your model

## Comparison: population mean

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Design-based

* Population: $X_1,X_2, \dots, X_N$, with large and finite N

* Sample indicator $Z_i \in \{0,1\} \forall i$, with

$$\sum_{i=1}^N Z_i = n$$

$$P(Z_i=1) = \frac{n}{N}$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Model-based

* Infinite populated characterized by a probability model

* Model can be parametric ($\cal{F}_{\theta}$) or non-parametric ($\cal{F}$)

* A collection of units of size $n: X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$

* $X_i$ is $i.i.d$ from $\cal{F}$

What we can measure is:
