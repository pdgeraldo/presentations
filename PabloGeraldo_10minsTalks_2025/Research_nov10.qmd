## Three pillars of my research

[**Social stratification**]{fig-align="center"}

- High-quality data, admin records (often restricted)

- Sophisticated methods for robust empirical evidence

## The rise of horizontal stratification

<br> The expansion of compulsory education during the 20th century was accompanied by contrasting expectations:

* [Equalizing effect on attainment and skills due to enrollment and attendance]{.fragment .highlight-blue}

* [Persistent inequality due to constrained decisions and qualitative differences]{.fragment .highlight-blue}

    
Between-school vocational tracking is a particularly relevant example of the latter 

It has been argued to have detrimental effects both in learning and educational expectations

[Its effects are challenging to study due to self-selection!]{.fragment .highlight-red}

# Illustration: School Tracking in Chile {background-color="#00a191"}


## Institutional context

* 40% of students attend vocational secondary schools

  - "Tracks" are not fixed/pipelined: one can go from vocational to general as long as you meet the academic requirements
  
  - 70% of students wants to follow tertiary education (independent of track)
  
  - Around 40% does within 5 years, much less completion
  
. . .

* Vocational schools are fewer but bigger, and they specialise 

  - Few mixed track schools mostly in the state sector
  
. . . 


* Institutional and curricular mismatch
  
  - Common curriculum in separate institutions!

## Challenges and opportunities

<br>

[Main challenge: (maybe) students in general and vocational schools are not comparable!]{.fragment .highlight-red}

. . .

The case of Chilean school tracking offers several theoretical and practical opportunities, making it a compelling case study:


* [Institutional/curricular mismatch allow to estimate the effect of attending a vocational school *net of curricular differentiation*]{.fragment .highlight-blue}


* [High-quality administrative and survey data allow for extensive confounding adjustment]{.fragment .highlight-blue}

  - Students followed from 4th to 10th grade
  - Parental background, previous performance, previous expectations


* [Comparatively less selected assignment]{.fragment .highlight-blue}
  
  - High proportion of students attend vocational schools


## Identification strategy

$\newcommand\indep{\perp\!\!\!\perp}$ 

**Approach**: conduct the study under different identification assumptions to deal with uncertainty about the "true causal model"

-   [**Selection on observables**:]{.fragment .highlight-blue} $\{Y_0, Y_1\} \indep \text{Vocational} ~\mid \text{ X}$

Where $X$ denotes students', parental and schools *observed* characteristics. Implemented using regression, matching, weighting, and DoubleML for estimation

-   [**Selection on time-invariant confounders**]{.fragment .highlight-blue}: $\{Y_0, Y_1\} \indep \text{Vocational} ~\mid \text{ X, U}$

Where $U$ denotes students' characteristics that are *unobserved* but constant over time. Implemented using difference-in-differences

## Identification strategy

-   [**Selection on time-varying confounding**]{.fragment .highlight-blue}

This is the main weakness of observational causal inference: *unobserved* time varying confounding is basically impossible to deal with.

There are, however, ways to incorporate at least partially this possibility:

-   [**Sensitivity Analysis**]{.fragment .highlight-blue}: How strong should unobserved confounding be to change our study's conclusions? 

-   [**Falsification/Placebo Test**]{.fragment .highlight-blue}: Use an outcome that should not be affected by the exposure of interest, but that one would expect to be affected by time-varying unobserved confounding.

I use parental income and education at the time the outcome was measured.

## Double ML estimation: PLR

We use machine learning algorithms to estimate two auxiliary models, $m_0$ and $g_0$, and specify a partially linear model (PLR) as follows:

$$
D = m_0(X) + V, ~ E[V|X] = 0
$$


$$
Y = D\theta_0 + g_0(X) + \zeta, ~ E[\zeta|D,X] = 0
$$

<br>

The assignment mechanism for treatment $D$ is flexibly estimated based on covariates $X$

The outcome model for $Y$ is flexibly estimated based on covariates $X$

Importantly, [we assume the treatment effect is not heterogeneous!]{.fragment .highlight-blue}



## Double ML estimation: PLR

We use machine learning algorithms to estimate two auxiliary models, $m_0$ and $g_0$, and specify an interactive regression model (IRM) as follows:

$$
D = m_0(X) + V, ~ E[V|X] = 0
$$


$$
Y = g_0(D,X) + U, ~ E[U|D,X] = 0
$$

The assignment mechanism for treatment $D$ is flexibly estimated based on covariates $X$

The outcome model for $Y$ is flexibly estimated based on covariates $X$

Importantly, [we allow the treatment effect to be fully heterogeneous!]{.fragment .highlight-red}

## Summary of results

<br>

* Attending an exclusively vocational high school decreases students performance in mathematics, *even before the curricular differentiation*

* Attending an exclusively vocational high school decreases students educational expectations, *even before the curricular differentiation*

* Some heterogeneity by previous performance:

  + Scores of formerly high achievers decreased the most
  
  + Expectations of formerly high achievers decreased the least, but unclear
